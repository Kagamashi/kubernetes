# Kustomize Commands with kubectl

Kustomize is natively integrated with `kubectl`, allowing you to apply, preview, and manage Kustomize configurations directly in a Kubernetes cluster without needing a separate Kustomize installation.

## Command Reference

| Command                      | Description                                                         |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `kubectl kustomize [path]`    | Output the final YAML generated by Kustomize.                       |
| `kubectl apply -k [path]`     | Apply the Kustomize-generated resources to the cluster.             |
| `kubectl delete -k [path]`    | Delete the Kustomize-generated resources from the cluster.          |
| `kubectl diff -k [path]`      | Show the difference between Kustomize output and live cluster state.|

---

## Viewing the Final Generated Manifest
Preview the final YAML manifest generated by Kustomize. This process runs the Kustomize build and outputs the result to the terminal.

### Example:
```bash
kubectl kustomize [path_to_kustomization_directory]
kubectl kustomize ./overlays/dev
```

---

## Applying Kustomize Manifests to the Cluster
The `-k` flag tells `kubectl` to treat the specified directory as a Kustomize directory containing a `kustomization.yaml` file.

### Example:
```bash
kubectl apply -k [path_to_kustomization_directory]
kubectl apply -k ./overlays/prod
```

---

## Deleting Resources Managed by Kustomize
Remove all resources defined in the specified Kustomize configuration from the cluster.

### Example:
```bash
kubectl delete -k [path_to_kustomization_directory]
```

---

## Diffing Changes with Kustomize
Show the differences between the current live state of resources in the cluster and the output of the Kustomize configuration.

### Example:
```bash
kubectl diff -k [path_to_kustomization_directory]
```
