## Scheduling in Kubernetes

### **Taints and Tolerations**
- **Taints** are applied to nodes and prevent Pods from being scheduled on the node unless the Pod has a matching toleration.
- **Tolerations** are applied to Pods and allow them to be scheduled on nodes with matching taints.

#### **Tainting a Node**:
```bash
kubectl taint nodes node1 key=value:NoSchedule
```
This taints the node `node1` with `key=value:NoSchedule`.

#### **Pod with a Matching Toleration**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  tolerations:
  - key: "key"
    operator: "Equal"
    value: "value"
    effect: "NoSchedule"
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
```

### **Affinity and Anti-Affinity**
Affinity and Anti-Affinity rules control how Pods are placed relative to other Pods. These rules can encourage Pods to be co-located on the same node (affinity) or ensure they are placed on different nodes (anti-affinity).

#### **Types of Affinity Rules**:
1. **Node Affinity**:
   - Specifies that a Pod should run on nodes with certain labels (e.g., specific types of hardware).

2. **Pod Affinity**:
   - Ensures Pods are co-located on the same node for improved performance or communication.

3. **Pod Anti-Affinity**:
   - Ensures Pods are placed on different nodes to achieve **high availability** by distributing workloads across nodes.

#### **Pod Anti-Affinity Example**:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app: my-app
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx
```

- **Key Features**:
  - `topologyKey`: Defines the topology scope for affinity rules (e.g., `kubernetes.io/hostname` ensures Pods are spread across nodes).
  - Pod Anti-Affinity ensures workloads are distributed to prevent single points of failure.

By leveraging Kubernetes scaling features (HPA, VPA, Cluster Autoscaler), Pod Security Admission (PSA), and advanced scheduling mechanisms like taints, tolerations, and affinity rules, you can optimize both the performance and security of your cluster.
