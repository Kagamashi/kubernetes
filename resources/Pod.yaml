# metadata: Contains the Pod’s metadata, such as its name, labels (for selection), and annotations (non-selective metadata).
# spec.containers: Defines the list of containers that run inside the Pod. Each container has:
  # name: Name of the container.
  # image: The image used by the container.
  # ports: Defines the ports exposed by the container.
  # env: List of environment variables for the container.
  # resources: Resource requests and limits for CPU and memory.
  # volumeMounts: Defines where volumes are mounted inside the container.
  # readinessProbe and livenessProbe: Health checks to determine if the container is ready to serve traffic and whether it is alive, respectively.
# initContainers: Containers that run before the main container is started. Useful for initialization tasks like database migrations.
# volumes: Defines volumes that can be shared among containers. In this case, an emptyDir volume is used, which is temporary storage created for the Pod.
# nodeSelector, tolerations, affinity: Scheduling options to control where the Pod is placed in the cluster.
# securityContext: Security-related settings, such as the user ID and group ID under which the containers run.
